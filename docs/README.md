# The Boring Framework
Welcome to The Boring Framework, a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)-inspired MVC framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Boring helps you do just that, create your turn wiring-up code into boring tasks (and maintain them) without having to put all the pieces together yourself; just focus on solving _your_ problems.

## Getting Started
It's easy to get started with The Boring Framework. Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/sodacitylabs/boring-framework/docs/tutorials/getting-started.md) to create your website, server and database (or hook up your own).

## The Command Line
The Command Line is the primary way to interact with Boring. Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/sodacitylabs/boring-framework/docs/cli/README.md) to see the commands available to you.

## ActiveRecord
ActiveRecord is how you'll deal with databases. Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/sodacitylabs/boring-framework/docs/activerecord/README.md) to learn about database migrations, model creation and persisting data to your database.

## Controllers
Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests for your application via standard _Action_ functions. Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/sodacitylabs/boring-framework/docs/controllers/README.md) to learn about using Controllers effectively.

## Database Migrations
Migrations allow you to manage your database schema over time. Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/sodacitylabs/boring-framework/docs/migrations/README.md).

## Sending Emails
You can send emails with Boring. Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/sodacitylabs/boring-framework/docs/mailer/README.md).

## Testing
Testing is baked into Boring at it's core. The test runner itself is used to run Boring's own test suite. Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/sodacitylabs/boring-framework/docs/testing/README.md) to get started writing tests for your own applications.
